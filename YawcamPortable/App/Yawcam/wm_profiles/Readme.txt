Yawcam Windows Media profile README
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This folder holds Windows media profiles stored in .prx files. The files can be used in Yawcam to specify the output format when the stream type is set to Windows Media.


Make new profiles of your own perferred output formats with the help of Windows Media Profile Editor. Download Windows Media Encoder to get it:

NOTE: Since the current version of Yawcam doesn't handle sound, you shall not add audio in the profiles you create. Profiles containing audio will make Yawcam stop the video stream.
